# Let's read some data. These are top-line 
# financials for the AmLaw 200 (the 200 largest
# law firms in the U.S., based on gross revenue).
# They are from 2015 (to keep me from getting into
# trouble with ALM, the entity that creates the 
# data and puts it behind a paywall), but it 
# gives a good sense of what the business land-
# scape for the "top" law firms looks like.

df<-read_csv("https://github.com/PrisonRodeo/PLSC476-SP2021-git/raw/master/Data/AmLaw200-2015.csv")
df<-as.data.frame(df) # get rid of the "tibble" business
df<-df[order(df$Rank2015),]  # sort the data...
rownames(df)<-df$Firm  # label the rows with firm names

# First, let's talk about the different "models" for
# law firms (pyramids vs. diamonds). A firm that is a 
# "diamond" has a high non-equity-partner-to-equity-partner 
# ratio; it also sometimes has few (or no) non-equity 
# partners (i.e., the numerator in the numerator of the 
# leverage statistic is the number of associates).
#
# A "diamond" firm has a relatively low number of 
# equity parntners, (relatively) few associates, and
# more non-equity partners and other "staff
# attorneys." It's leverage may also be high or
# low.
#
# The number of associates is equal to the number of
# lawyers, minus the number of equity and non-equity
# partners:

df$NAssociates<-df$NLawyers - (df$NEquityPartners+df$NNonEquityPartners)
summary(df$NAssociates)

# A "pyramid" firm:

df[df$Firm=="Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom",c(12:14,16,21)]

# A "diamond" firm:

df[df$Firm=="Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith",c(12:14,16,21)]

# Now let's make some plots. First, revenue in the
# "top 20":

# Now, we'll classify firms as pyramids or diamonds.
# Some decision rules:
#
# 1. If a firm has zero non-equity partners, it's
#    automatically a pyramid;
#
# 2. If a firm has more non-equity partners than
#    associates, it's automatically a diamond;
#
# 3. If a firm has more than zero non-equity 
#    partners, but fewer non-equity partners than
#    associates, then:
#    A) it will be classified as a pyramid if the ratio
#       of non-equity partners to associates is less
#       than 0.5 (that is, if there are at least two
#       associates for every non-equity partner),
#    B) it will be classified as a diamond if the ratio
#       of non-equity partners to associates is greater
#       than 0.5 (that is, if there are fewer than two
#       associates for every non-equity partner).
