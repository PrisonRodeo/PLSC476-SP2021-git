# Analysis: Cases involving labor unions...
#
# Subset the data to union-related cases ONLY: 
# Those are the ones where the "issueArea" variable 
# has a value of 7:

UnionDF<-DF[DF$issueArea==7 & is.na(DF$issueArea)==FALSE,]

# Check to make sure that worked:

table(UnionDF$issueArea)

# Q: How many union-related cases has the Court 
# heard? We can plot this by term, but to do that
# we need to aggregate these vote-level data so
# that there is one line of data per case:

CountByTerm<-aggregate(term~docketId,mean,data=UnionDF)

# Pro-Union Voting and Decisions...
#
# Note that the database defines pro-union
# votes as "liberal," EXCEPT in cases of 
# union antitrust (where the "issue" variable
# equals 70020). So we can create a pro-
# union vote variable as:

UnionDF$ProUnionVote = UnionDF$direction-1
UnionDF$ProUnionVote<-ifelse(UnionDF$issue==70020,
                             1-UnionDF$ProUnionVote,

# Now, examine the fraction of pro-union votes 
# over time. This code creates a yearly summary
# of the fraction of pro-union votes by the
# Court, and a "term" variable to plot it 
# against:

AnnualUnion<-with(UnionDF,prop.table(xtabs(~term+ProUnionVote),1))

# Finally: Change over time...
#
# Q: Does the association between ideology and pro-union
# voting remain the same over time, or does it change?
#
# We'll use the vote-level data to get at this. 
# Specifically, we'll calculate the strength of the
# association between ideology and pro-union votes
# separately for each term of the Court, then
# plot those associations over time to see if there 
# is a pattern.
#
# To do this, we'll write a loop function. This
# will 

# First, create a place to put our Pearson 
# correlations between the Martin-Quinn score and
# pro-union voting.

NTerms <- length(unique(UnionDF$term)) # no. of terms 
                                       # in the union data

r.SC<-numeric(NTerms) # These are currently "empty"
r.MQ<-numeric(NTerms) # objects...

# Now make a list of every term in which the Court
# decided at least one union-related case:

TermList <- unique(UnionDF$term) # list of terms in which there
                                 # were union cases decided

# Now, we'll write a loop that will:
#
# 1) Extract the vote-level data from a given Court term,
# 2) Calculate the Pearson's correlation between pro-union
#    votes and the two ideology measures *for that term*,
#    and
# 3) Record each of those correlations in the objects
#    "r.SC" and "r.MQ" that we created above:

for(i in 1:NTerms) { # loop over values from 1 to 67
  # create a single-term dataframe called "df", 
  # with the term equal to the "i"th entry in "TermList":
    df<-UnionDF[UnionDF$term==TermList[i],]
  # Calculate the Pro-union vote / ideology correlation
  # for that term's votes, first using the Segal-Cover
  # measure, then the Martin-Quinn measure, and store
  # that value in the "i"th entry of either r.SC or
  # r.MQ:
    r.SC[i] <- with(df, cor(ProUnionVote,SCScore,
                            use="complete.obs"))
    r.MQ[i] <- with(df, cor(ProUnionVote,MQScore,
                            use="complete.obs"))
} # Done.

# Note that for some of the terms we are not able to
# calculate a Pearson's correlation.
#
# We can plot the correlation coefficients over time:

pdf("UnionRsOverTime.pdf",6,5)
par(mar=c(4,4,2,2))
plot(TermList,r.SC,t="l",lwd=2,xlab="Term",

lines(TermList,r.MQ,lwd=2,lty=2,col="red")
abline(h=0,lty=3) # horizontal line at 0
dev.off()

# If we want to know if the strength of the association
# (that is, the Pearson r statistics) are changing
# systematically over time, one way to do that is 
# to treat the Pearson's r coefficients themselves
# as data, and see if they vary systematically with
# the term of the Court. We can use linear regression
# again to do that:

fit.r.SC<-lm(r.SC~TermList)
summary(fit.r.SC)
fit.r.MQ<-lm(r.MQ~TermList)
summary(fit.r.MQ)

# We can illustrate that regression by again plotting
# the Pearson correlations against "term," but this
# time adding a regression line to each:
